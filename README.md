# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis, I examined data from Pewlett-Hackerd in order to determine the count of retirement-eligible and mentorship-eligible employees. Based on the results of this analysis, I made recommendations regarding preparation for the coming wave of retirements.

## Results

- I created a table that lists the details of retirement-eligible employees with only their most recent titles in order to remove duplicate employees.

- Among the retirement-eligible pool of employees are 29,414 Senior Engineers and 28,254 Senior Staff. In other words, 57,668 senior-level employees could retire at any time.

- Only two department managers are currently eligible for retirement, which suggests that senior leadership should remain stable.

- I also created a table of current employees born in the year 1965 as they are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
Out of Pewelett-Hackard's 240,124 employees, 90,398 employees (or approximately 37.6% of the company's workforce) are eligible for retirement. With so many employees ready to retire at any time, the company must aggressively hire more employees within the next few years. Furthermore, as 57,668 of the retirement-eligible employees are in senior-level positions, Pewlett-Hackard must especially focus on finding talent with a wealth of skills and experiences.

This could in small part be addressed by the mentorship program. Currently, 1,549 are eligible to participate. And as this small pool already includes 169 Senior Engineers and 569 Senior Staff, there would be very few of the more junior employees that need to be mentored by retiring employees. Furthermore, as only two managers are retiring as opposed to 738 senior-level employees eligible for mentorships, there should be very little trouble filling in managerial positions.

However, this small pool is nowhere near enough to fill in for all the senior level employees set to retire. The retirement-eligible pool is more than 58 times the size of the mentorship-eligible pool. Because of this, Pewlett-Hackard must put more energy into mid-career recruitment and/or expand eligibility for the mentorship program.
